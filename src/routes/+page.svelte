			Some people might groan: "What a load of rubbish!", as FIRLEFANZ (frippery) may be considered
			by the general public as worthless stuff - something you don't really need in your life. For
			others, Firlefanz refers to nonsensical talk or even absurd ideas. "Der/Die hat doch nur

			The term ‘Firlefanz’ originates from the Middle High German word ‘virlefanz’, meaning a ‘sort
			of dance' where people sung and circled around. Later, ‘Firlefanz’ emerged, drawing
			inspiration from 'alfanz,' initially a comical embellishment in architecture, later applied in
			Modern High German to describe foppish, silly manners or crude yet amusing pranks.

			of Firlefanz for an ecstatic rave throughout the night - or as those 14th century Middle High
			Germans would have called it - a “sort of dance”.
